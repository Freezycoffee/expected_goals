<h1>Create an expected goals model using pytorch</h1><br>
I previously made an expected goals model using XGBoost and BayesianOptimization but since BayesianOptimization has no longer made an update I decided to scrap the previous model and create a new one using pytorch.<br>
<br>
<br>
The data used in this model is shot data from FIFA U-17 World Cup by Opta data. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bZtyrE2IG4yjEFkn8h4a1AtQArVAcHRe/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=113414266323662377679&rtpof=true&sd=true
